# prosEO – the Processing System for Earth Observation Data


## Introduction

The “prosEO” software system is an open-source processing control system is designed to perform all activities required to process
Earth Observation satellite data (e. g. Sentinel data), generating user-level data, engineering data and/or housekeeping telemetry
data as desired by a configured mission. The technical infrastructure used to deliver the Production Service is a cloud-native
multi-mission infrastructure by design, with strict separation of competences and concerns.

A full description of the design approach can be found on the
[prosEO Wiki](https://github.com/dlr-eoc/prosEO/wiki/Building-a-Production-Service-Based-on-prosEO).


## License

prosEO is licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3.


## Installation

prosEO is a very complex system, therefore no single installer can be provided. A deployment guide on the Wiki will be added
in due course.


## Documentation

All documentation can be found on the [prosEO Wiki](https://github.com/dlr-eoc/prosEO/wiki).


## Contributions

prosEO is currently developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) together with Dr. Bassler & Co. Managementberatung (BCM) and
Prophos Informatik. For contributions to the project please contact [tangobravo62](mailto:thomas.bassler@drbassler.de).
