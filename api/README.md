CSC Operations Framework API
============================

The modules contained in the "api" folder implement functionality useful or necessary to run prosEO in an environment
as defined for the Copernicus Space Component in the document "CSC Operations â€“ ESA Framework Ground Segment Architecture"
(ESA-EOPG-EOPGC-TN-7, issue 1.2 at the time of writing).

The modules herein include:
- APIs provided to external partners
  - Production Service Interface Delivery Point (PRIP)
  - On-demand Production Service Interface Delivery Point (ODIP)
- APIs used to access services by external partners
  - Management service for product archive endpoints
  - Client for Archive Interface Points (AIP)
  - Monitor for Auxiliary Interface Points (AUXIP)
  - Monitor for X-band Interface Points (XBIP)
  - Monitor for EDRS Interface Points (EIP/EDIP)
  
Modules for further ESA-defined interfaces will be added from time to time as the Ground Segment Architecture evolves.
