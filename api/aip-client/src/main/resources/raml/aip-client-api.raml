        nothing and just return the product metadata. If it is not available locally, query all configured LTAs for a product
        with the given file name, the first response is returned to the caller, then download from the LTA and ingested

        If it already is available there, do nothing and just return the product metadata.
        If it is not available locally, query all configured LTAs for a product with the given search criteria.
        The first response is evaluated: If multiple products fulfilling the criteria are found in the LTA, the product with the
        most recent generation time will be used. In the (unlikely) case of several products having the same generation time,
        the product with the greatest file name (alphanumeric string comparison) will be used.
        The product metadata is returned to the caller, then the product is downloaded from the LTA and ingested
        at the given processing facility.
