Populate this directory with valid server certificates named `servercert.pem` and `serverkey.pem`:
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout serverkey.pem -out servercert.pem -days 3650 -nodes
```

Note that for a deployment with LetsEncrypt these are only dummies, which will be replaced by the Certbot.
For other deployments this should be valid server certificates. Where intermediate certificates are required, these must be 
concatenated with the server certificate into a single file named `servercert.pem`.
