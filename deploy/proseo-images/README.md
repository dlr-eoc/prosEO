prosEO Image Build Example
==========================

The steps below are intended to be run on a development machine, not in the target environment (which will probably not yet be
available at this point).


# Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before starting the build process:
- Successful and recent `mvn clean install -DskipTests` in the prosEO repository root,
- Access to a valid and working Docker registry (`docker login <registry-url>` shall be successful).


# Required configuration

Before building the images, the following secrets need to be determined:
- The database password
- The shared secret of the prosEO Ingestor and the prosEO Storage Manager
- The authentication token for the InfluxDB monitoring database (an alphanumeric token of e. g. 32 characters length)

Then for all prosEO components (all subdirectories in `proseo-components` except `proseo-db` and `proseo-pgadmin`)
the file `application.yml.template` needs to be copied into a new file `application.yml`. The following updates are then needed
for the new `application.yml` files:
- All files except in `proseo-ui-gui` and `proseo-storage-mgr`: Set the database password in the property `spring.datasource.password`.
- In `proseo-ingestor` and `proseo-storage-mgr`: Set the shared secret in the property `proseo.storageManager.secret`.
- In `proseo-ingestor`, `proseo-planner` and `proseo-order-mgr`: If logging in an InfluxDB is to be used:
  - Uncomment the properties under `proseo.log`.
  - Set the InfluxDB authentication token in the property `proseo.log.token`.
  - Set the correct IP address for the loghost in the property `proseo.log.host`.
- In `proseo-storage-mgr`: If an S3 backend storage is to be used, the S3 endpoint, the region and the credentials
  (access key, secret access key) must be configured.

Changes to the logging configuration may be applied to the `logback.xml` files as needed, however the standard configuration
should be a reasonable starting point.


# Build all deployment docker images

The build process creates new images with the specific `application.yml` and `logback.xml` files. The build process is started
for a specific registry (e. g. `proseo-registry.eoc.dlr.de`), which is passed as parameter to the build script:
```sh
./build_images.sh <registry-url>
```

# Push all images

After the build the new images need to be pushed to the target registry (e. g. `proseo-registry.eoc.dlr.de`),
which again is passed as parameter to the push script:
```sh
./push_images.sh <registry-url>
```
