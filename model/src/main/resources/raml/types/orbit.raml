    description: |
        The description of an orbit identified by its start and stop times.
        There must be no time gap between subsequent orbits of the same spacecraft.
        Orbit times (and all derived times in prosEO) are given in UTC-STS (leap seconds spread evenly over the last 1000 seconds
        of the day) and to a microsecond precision. Therefore, all timestamps use the "Z" (UTC) time zone code.
    properties:
      id?:
        type: integer
        format: long
        default: 0
        description: The persistent id of this object
      version?:
        type: integer
        default: 1
        description: A version identifier to track updates to the object (especially to detect concurrent update attempts)
      missionCode:
        type: string
        description: The mission code (e. g. S5P)
      spacecraftCode:
        type: string
        description: The short code for the spacecraft (e. g. TDX1)
      orbitNumber:
        type: integer
        description: The orbit number (usually starting at 1 at launch); unique for a spacecraft and usually gapless
      startTime:
        type: string
        description: The start time of the orbit (e. g. using a Spacecraft Midnight Crossing [SMX] event) in orbit format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.SSSSSS)
        pattern: ^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\dT\d\d:\d\d:\d\d.\d{6}$
      stopTime:
        type: string
        description: The stop time of the orbit (e. g. using a Spacecraft Midnight Crossing [SMX] event) in orbit format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.SSSSSS); 
            usually the stop time of one orbit is the start time of the subsequent orbit 
        pattern: ^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\dT\d\d:\d\d:\d\d.\d{6}$
