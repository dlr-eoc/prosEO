title: prosEO UI Command Line Interface Syntax
# This document describes the syntax of the prosEO Command Line Interface. It is inteded to be fed into the syntax parser of the
# command line program and to be returned as online help for the user.
version: v0.1
description: |
  The general syntax for commands is:
  
    command [subcommand...] [option...] [parameter...]
  
  Commands can be entered after the "prosEO>" command prompt. They can also be invoked on the shell command line 
  following the name of the prosEO executable (e. g. "proseo") and at least one whitespace character.
  
  Commands may have subcommands, which precede all options and parameters.
  
  Commands may have options (--option, a short form -o may be given as alias) and parameters
  (passed as values without the parameter name).
  
  Modal options can be combined into one option, i. e. "-a -b -c" is the same as "-abc".
  Options with values are either of the form "-ovalue" or "--option=value";
  in the case of multiple values "--option=value,value,value".
  
  Parameters are positional, except (implicitly) for attribute parameters of the form "<attribute name>=<attribute value>".
  Attribute values may be comma-separated string lists, but they cannot represent attributes of more complex types. To set
  complex object attributes use the "--file" option and pass a Json, XML or Yaml file.
  
  Options and parameters containing blanks and/or quotes must be quoted, e. g. "-ovalue with blanks" or 'My "quoted" parameter'.
  
  All date-time values must conform to the ISO date-time format ("YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM:SS.ssssssZ]"), with or without a second,
  a fraction of second and/or a time zone, e. g. the following are valid:
  "2020-04-08", "2020-04-08T11:30+0200", "2020-04-08T11:30:45.123456Z".
  Value parts not specified will be set to zero, i. e. "2020-04-08" will be interpreted as "2020-04-08T00:00:00.000000" in UTC.
  Therefore when specifying a time interval using "from"/"to" parameters, be sure to specify the end of the interval correctly,
  e. g. to cover the whole day 2020-04-08 (in UTC), "2020-04-08" may be specified for the "from" parameter, but the "to" parameter
  must read "2020-04-08T23:59:59.999999" or "2020-04-09".
  
  For all commands except "mission show" a user login is required, all commands except "mission show", "mission create",
  "user create" and all facility-related commands require login to a specific mission.
  
  Caution 1: Typing ^C (Control-C) terminates the Command Line Interface immediately.
  Caution 2: When run in non-interactive mode (e. g. with input redirection) prompts for missing mandatory attributes do not work.
             In this case mandatory attributes must be specified on the command line or in an input file.
             (Exception: Selection rules can be read from input redirection.)
