title: prosEO UI Command Line Interface Syntax
# This document describes the syntax of the prosEO Command Line Interface. It is inteded to be fed into the syntax parser of the
# command line program and to be returned as online help for the user.
version: v0.1
description: |
  Commands can be entered after the "prosEO>" command prompt. They can also be invoked on the shell command line 
  following the name of the prosEO executable (e. g. "proseo") and at least one whitespace character.
  
  Commands may have subcommands, which precede all options and parameters.
  
  Commands may have options (--option, a short form -o may be given as alias) and parameters
  (passed as values without the parameter name).
  
  Modal options can be combined into one option, i. e. "-a -b -c" is the same as "-abc".
  Options with values are either of the form "-ovalue" or "--option=value";
  in the case of multiple values "--option=value,value,value".
  
  Parameters are positional, except (implicitly) for attribute parameters of the form "<attribute name>=<attribute value>".
  Attribute values may be comma-separated string lists, but they cannot represent attributes of more complex types. To set
  complex object attributes use the "--file" option and pass a Json, XML or Yaml file.
  
  All date-time values must conform to the ISO date-time format ("YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS").
  
  So the general syntax is:
  command [subcommand...] [option...] [parameter...]
